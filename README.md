Dear Pragmatic Programmers Editorial Team,

I’m very excited to submit to you the materials for my proposed book, *WebRTC: Build Real-Time Web Applications in the Browser*.

I have attached to this email a ZIP file containing one markdown file each for the proposal, which I have written to your template, and the sample chapter. Because I’m a firm believer in redundancy, I have also quietly stashed a copy of my proposal files in a repo in an unadvertised GitHub organization at https://github.com/prag-webrtc/proposal.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,  
Karl
